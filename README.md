# Spam Email Classification with Deep Learning + IBM Granite

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on spam email classification using deep learning.  
The workflow includes data preprocessing, text transformation, and training a classification model.  
IBM Granite AI was integrated to assist in data exploration, visualization, and class balancing automation.

## 📂 Dataset
Dataset: [Spam Email Dataset](<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mfaisalqureshi/spam-email>)  
Shape: 5572 rows × 2 columns

## 🔎 Insight & Findings
- Found X% spam vs Y% ham imbalance.
- Spam messages are typically shorter/longer and contain more promotional keywords.
- Visualization showed distinct patterns between ham and spam word distributions.

## 🤖 AI Support Explanation
IBM Granite was used to:
- Replace manual pandas operations with natural language queries.
- Automate visualization tasks (histograms, pie charts, WordCloud).
- Assist in rebalancing dataset (undersampling).

## 📊 Example
Example Granite prompt used:  
`"Show the count of each label in the 'category' column."`

## 📝 How to Run
- Open the notebook in Google Colab.
- Install dependencies
- Mount Google Drive and run cells sequentially.
